# Security Threat Intelligence (STI) Project
## Project Execution Plan

### Project Objective
To develop an automated system that identifies and tracks potential security vulnerabilities affecting our infrastructure by scanning threat feeds and correlating them with our internal asset inventory.

### Key Deliverables
1. Automated vulnerability scanning system
2. Asset inventory management system
3. Email alert system for critical vulnerabilities
4. Web-based dashboard for tracking and reporting

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
- Set up development environment
- Implement NIST NVD feed integration
- Create basic asset inventory database
- Develop essential backend services
- Basic email alerting for critical vulnerabilities

#### Phase 2: Enhancement (Weeks 4-6)
- Add additional security feeds
- Implement asset-vulnerability correlation
- Develop web dashboard
- Add user authentication
- Enhanced reporting capabilities

#### Phase 3: Production (Weeks 7-8)
- System testing and optimization
- Migration to production environment
- Team training
- Documentation completion

### Technical Stack
- Backend: Go (reliability & performance)
- Frontend: React (user interface)
- Database: PostgreSQL (data storage)
- Environment: RHEL 8 (production server)

### Success Metrics
- Successful weekly automated scans
- Accurate vulnerability-asset correlation
- Timely critical vulnerability alerts
- IT team integration for remediation tracking
