# Security Threat Intelligence (STI) System
## Project Documentation Package

### 1. Project Overview
- **Purpose**: Automated vulnerability scanning and tracking system
- **Primary Goals**:
  * Aggregate vulnerability data from security feeds
  * Map vulnerabilities to internal assets
  * Track remediation status
  * Provide reporting capabilities

### 2. System Architecture
- **Backend** (Go):
  * Feed Processing Service
  * Asset Management Service
  * Correlation Engine
  * Alert Service
  
- **Frontend** (React):
  * Admin Dashboard
  * User Dashboard
  * Asset Management Interface
  * Reporting Interface

- **Database** (PostgreSQL):
  * Vulnerability data
  * Asset inventory
  * Correlation mappings
  * Audit logs

### 3. Development Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (2-3 weeks)
1. Basic Feed Processing
   - Implement NIST NVD API integration
   - Parse and store vulnerability data
   - Basic email alerting

2. Asset Management
   - Excel import functionality
   - Basic asset database
   - Simple correlation logic

3. Basic Frontend
   - Authentication
   - Vulnerability display
   - Manual scan trigger

#### Phase 2: Core Features (3-4 weeks)
1. Enhanced Feed Processing
   - Additional feed sources
   - Deduplication logic
   - Enhanced correlation

2. Complete Asset Management
   - Full CRUD operations
   - Version tracking
   - Audit logging

3. Enhanced Frontend
   - Advanced filtering
   - Reporting
   - User management

#### Phase 3: Production Ready (2-3 weeks)
1. Testing & Hardening
   - Security testing
   - Performance optimization
   - Error handling

2. Documentation
   - User guides
   - API documentation
   - Deployment guides

3. Production Deployment
   - RHEL setup
   - Database migration
   - Monitoring setup
